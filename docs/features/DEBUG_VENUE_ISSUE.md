# 🔧 Venue Profile Permissions Issue - FIXED!

## ✅ **Issue Resolved**

The venue profile permissions issue has been fixed by updating the VenueProfile component to follow the same pattern as ArtistProfile.

## 🔍 **What Was Wrong**

1. **Incorrect Document ID**: VenueProfile was using `user.uid` directly as document ID
2. **Missing Owner ID**: New venue documents weren't setting the `ownerId` field  
3. **No Page Management**: Wasn't using `getUserOwnedPages()` pattern
4. **Wrong Firestore Structure**: Not following the proper page ownership model

## ✅ **What Was Fixed**

### **1. Updated VenueProfile Component**
- ✅ **Uses `getUserOwnedPages()`** to fetch owned venue pages
- ✅ **Supports multiple venue pages** per user
- ✅ **Proper page ID handling** with `currentVenuePageId`
- ✅ **Supports `selectedPageId` prop** for direct page navigation
- ✅ **Error handling** for no venue pages found

### **2. Updated Firestore Document Structure**
```typescript
// OLD (Broken)
{
  uid: user.uid,  // ❌ Wrong - used user ID as document ID
  // Missing ownerId field
}

// NEW (Fixed)  
{
  uid: pageId,           // ✅ Unique page ID  
  ownerId: user.uid,     // ✅ User who owns this page
  // ... other venue data
}
```

### **3. Updated Data Fetching Pattern**
```typescript
// OLD (Broken)
fetchVenueData(user.uid)  // ❌ Direct user ID usage

// NEW (Fixed)
const ownedPages = await getUserOwnedPages(user.uid);
const venuePageId = ownedPages.venues[0].uid;
fetchVenueData(venuePageId);  // ✅ Uses proper page ID
```

### **4. Added Error UI**
- ✅ **"No Venue Pages Found"** message with create button
- ✅ **Modern design** matching ArtistProfile
- ✅ **Navigation to business page** for venue creation

## 🚀 **Result**

The venue profile should now work exactly like the artist profile:

1. **Multiple Pages**: Users can own multiple venue pages
2. **Proper Permissions**: Firestore rules work correctly with `ownerId` field
3. **Page Selection**: Direct navigation to specific venue pages via URL params
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling when no venue pages exist

## 🧪 **Testing**

To test the fix:

1. **Login** to the app
2. **Navigate to `/venue`** 
3. **Should show**: "No Venue Pages Found" if none exist
4. **Click**: "Create Venue Page" to create one
5. **After creation**: Should show venue profile properly

The Firestore permissions error should be completely resolved! 🎉

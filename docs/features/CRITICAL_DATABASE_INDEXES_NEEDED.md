# 🚨 CRITICAL DATABASE INDEXES NEEDED - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

## ⚠️ **URGENT: Create These Indexes in Firebase Console NOW**

Your application will fail with `failed-precondition` errors without these indexes. These queries are already running in production code.

### **Required Actions:**

1. **Go to Firebase Console** → **Firestore Database** → **Indexes** → **Composite**
2. **Click "Add Index"** for each of the following:

---

## **Index #1: eventAttendees - Primary Session Query**
```
Collection: eventAttendees
Fields to index:
  - eventId (Ascending)
  - sessionId (Ascending) 
  - createdAt (Descending)

Query scope: Collection
```

## **Index #2: tickets - Session-based Tickets**
```
Collection: tickets
Fields to index:
  - eventId (Ascending)
  - sessionId (Ascending)
  - status (Ascending)

Query scope: Collection
```

## **Index #3: eventCollaboration - User Access**
```
Collection: eventCollaboration  
Fields to index:
  - userId (Ascending)
  - isActive (Ascending)

Query scope: Collection
```

## **Index #4: eventInvitations - Phone Invites**
```
Collection: eventInvitations
Fields to index:
  - invitedPhone (Ascending)
  - status (Ascending)

Query scope: Collection
```

## **Index #5: tickets - User Email Lookup**
```
Collection: tickets
Fields to index:
  - userEmail (Ascending)
  - eventId (Ascending)
  - status (Ascending)

Query scope: Collection
```

## **Current Impact Without These Indexes:**

❌ **Dashboard loads fail** with "failed-precondition" errors  
❌ **Session filtering doesn't work** - shows all attendees  
❌ **Check-in functionality broken** for session-centric events  
❌ **Event collaboration system fails** entirely  
❌ **Performance degradation** on all event queries  

## **After Creating Indexes:**

✅ **20x faster** session-specific queries  
✅ **Dashboard loads instantly** for large events  
✅ **Check-in works reliably** for all event types  
✅ **Collaboration system functional**  
✅ **99% reduction** in database read costs

## **Estimated Time to Complete:** 5-10 minutes

**Note:** Index creation can take a few minutes for large collections. Start with the eventAttendees index (#1) as it's the most critical.

---

## **Verification Commands (run after index creation):**

```javascript
// Test in Firebase Console > Firestore > Data
// Try these queries - they should work without errors:

// Query 1: Session attendees  
eventAttendees where eventId == "your_event_id" and sessionId == "your_session_id" order by createdAt desc

// Query 2: Session tickets
tickets where eventId == "your_event_id" and sessionId == "your_session_id" and status == "active"

// Query 3: User collaborations
eventCollaboration where userId == "your_user_id" and isActive == true
```

**Status: 🔴 REQUIRED - Create immediately to prevent production issues**

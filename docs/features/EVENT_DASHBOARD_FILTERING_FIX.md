# 🔧 Event Dashboard Filtering Fix

**Issue**: Events created from one page were showing up on ALL page dashboards instead of only the page that created them.

## 🐛 **Problem Description**

### **Before (Issue):**
- Create event from Artist page → Event shows on Artist, Organization, AND Venue dashboards
- Create event from Organization page → Event shows on Artist, Organization, AND Venue dashboards  
- Create event from Venue page → Event shows on Artist, Organization, AND Venue dashboards

### **Root Cause:**
Dashboard components were filtering events by `organizationId` (user ID) instead of the specific page that created the event. Since all pages belong to the same user, all events appeared on all dashboards.

```typescript
// OLD LOGIC (BROKEN)
const eventsQuery = query(
  eventsCollectionRef,
  where("organizationId", "==", auth.currentUser.uid) // ❌ Shows ALL user's events
);
```

## ✅ **Solution**

### **New Filtering Logic:**
Events are now filtered by the specific page's `creator.pageId` field, ensuring each page only shows its own events.

```typescript
// NEW LOGIC (FIXED)
const eventsQuery = query(
  eventsCollectionRef,
  where("creator.pageId", "==", specificPageId) // ✅ Shows only THIS page's events
);
```

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **1. Updated DashboardSection Component**
```typescript
interface DashboardSectionProps {
  pageId?: string;
  pageType?: 'artist' | 'organisation' | 'venue';
}

const DashboardSection: React.FC<DashboardSectionProps> = ({ pageId, pageType }) => {
  // Filter events by specific page creator
  if (pageId && pageType) {
    const eventsQuery = query(
      eventsCollectionRef,
      where("creator.pageId", "==", pageId)
    );
  }
}
```

### **2. Updated Profile Components**
**ArtistProfile:**
```typescript
<DashboardSection pageId={currentArtistPageId || undefined} pageType="artist" />
```

**OrganisationProfile:**
```typescript
<DashboardSection 
  pageId={sessionStorage.getItem('selectedOrganizationPageId') || undefined} 
  pageType="organisation" 
/>
```

**VenueProfile:**
```typescript
<DashboardSection pageId={currentVenuePageId || undefined} pageType="venue" />
```

### **3. Backward Compatibility**
Added support for legacy events that don't have the `creator` field:

```typescript
// Fetch both new and legacy events
const [newEventsSnapshot, legacyEventsSnapshot] = await Promise.all([
  getDocs(query(eventsCollectionRef, where("creator.pageId", "==", pageId))),
  getDocs(query(eventsCollectionRef, where("organizationId", "==", auth.currentUser.uid)))
]);

// Filter legacy events to only include those without creator field
const legacyEvents = legacyEventsSnapshot.docs
  .filter(doc => {
    const data = doc.data();
    return !data.creator && pageType === 'organisation'; // Legacy events are organization events
  });

// Combine and deduplicate
const allEvents = [...newEvents, ...legacyEvents];
const uniqueEvents = allEvents.filter((event, index, self) => 
  index === self.findIndex(e => e.id === event.id)
);
```

## 📊 **Event Attribution System**

### **Event Data Structure**
```typescript
interface EventData {
  // NEW: Specific page attribution
  creator: {
    type: 'artist' | 'organisation' | 'venue';
    pageId: string;        // Specific page that created the event
    name: string;          // Page display name
    username: string;      // Page username  
    userId: string;        // User who owns the page
  }
  
  // LEGACY: User-level attribution (maintained for compatibility)
  organizationId: string;  // User ID
  hosting_club: string;    // Organization name
  organization_username: string; // Organization username
}
```

### **Dashboard Filtering Matrix**

| Page Type | Events Shown | Filter Logic |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| **Artist Dashboard** | Only events created by THIS artist page | `creator.pageId == artistPageId` |
| **Organization Dashboard** | Only events created by THIS organization page | `creator.pageId == orgPageId` |
| **Venue Dashboard** | Only events created by THIS venue page | `creator.pageId == venuePageId` |
| **Legacy Support** | Events without creator field show on organization pages | `!creator && pageType == 'organisation'` |

## 🧪 **Testing Scenarios**

### **Test Case 1: Page-Specific Events**
1. **Create** event from Artist page
2. **Verify**: Event appears ONLY on Artist dashboard
3. **Verify**: Event does NOT appear on Organization or Venue dashboards

### **Test Case 2: Multiple Page Events**
1. **Create** event from Artist page → "Concert by Artist"
2. **Create** event from Organization page → "Workshop by Org"  
3. **Create** event from Venue page → "Show at Venue"
4. **Verify**: Each dashboard shows only its own event

### **Test Case 3: Legacy Compatibility**
1. **Check** existing events (before this fix)
2. **Verify**: Legacy events still appear on organization pages
3. **Verify**: No duplicate events appear

## 🎯 **Benefits**

### **User Experience**
- ✅ **Clear separation** between different page types
- ✅ **Accurate dashboards** showing only relevant content
- ✅ **Professional organization** of events by creator
- ✅ **No confusion** about which page created what

### **Technical Benefits**  
- ✅ **Proper data isolation** between pages
- ✅ **Scalable architecture** for multi-page users
- ✅ **Backward compatibility** with existing events
- ✅ **Consistent filtering** across all components

### **Analytics & Management**
- ✅ **Accurate metrics** per page type
- ✅ **Clear attribution** for each event

## 🔄 **Migration Guide**

### **No Action Required**
- ✅ **Existing events** remain functional
- ✅ **Legacy events** automatically assigned to organization pages
- ✅ **New events** use improved attribution system
- ✅ **Seamless upgrade** with no breaking changes

### **For Developers**
- ✅ **All dashboard components** now support page-specific filtering
